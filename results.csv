0,"Okay, so I just watched this all-Midget (sorry, Little People) Western. Now, while I laughed at some of the way their sizes were exploited like when one fell carrying some boxes that blocked his face or when a townsperson drank a giant glass of beer (I think Jerry Maren played the latter by the way), overall I don't think this deserves the moniker of one of ""The Fifty Worst Films of All Time"" as implied in the book of that name. In fact, for the most part I was quite excited at the way the whole thing was filmed and liked many of the performances especially Billy Curtis as the Hero, Buck Lawson, and ""Little Billy"" Rhodes as the Villain, Bat Haines. They have a great fight scene at the climax. Yvonne Moray as the Heroine, Nancy Preston, and Nita Krabs as the Dance Hall Girl, Nita, who loves Bat are also good in their roles. And then there's Charles Becker as the Comic Relief, Otto the Cook, who has a pretty intentionally funny scene with a duck he's trying to kill as he tries to sweet talk him. The singing is wonderful, too, though hearing an obviously taller male voice coming out of Curtis' mouth was pretty strange especially in contrast to Ms. Murray's natural warbling voice after that. By the way, the only actual tall person that appears is in the beginning when an announcer steps from behind the curtain to introduce the Hero and Villain (with the requisite ""boos"" and ""hiss""!) before the opening credits. So on that note, I'd recommend The Terror of Tiny Town to anyone who likes a good-old fashioned musical western starring talented little people.",0
1,"I watched this in preparation for Herzog's dwarf film. He requires some time in the wilderness.

In the early 30's there were some precode films that copied already established genres but with toddlers playing the roles. I commented on two: ""War Babies"" and ""Runt Pages."" Recently, I saw ""Baby Geniuses,"" which borrowed heavily in spirit — but without the sex jokes.

This is also modeled in a way on those, but is schizophrenic.

It was the same year that ""Wizard of Oz,"" used little people in a serious way to introduce the distorted magic of Oz. (This was before we could rely on Dr Suess.) Nearly all of these actors were in that scene, with its grueling shoot. The actual story is played almost perfectly straight. A standard script is used: cowboy romance, ""Romeo and Juliette"" family feud and romance, cattle rustling, corrupt sheriff, barroom moll... the whole works. These actors and the director take the movie seriously.

On the other hand, a different director managed the musical numbers. There are a half dozen, and the novelty of little people is played to the hilt, using some actual children I think where cuteness is required. The shift in stance is radical. You can see that distributor realized that they had a problem, so here is what they did:

At the beginning, an announcer comes on ""stage"" to announce that we would see a ""novelty picture"" with ""midgets."" A one of a kind, first ever, he effuses. But he is interrupted by the actor playing the hero, who assures him that the movie is not a novelty but a real film. Then he and the film's villain engage in a bit of scripted verbal slapping that someone thought was a successful synthesis of worlds.

Here's what interests me: mainstream movies have only a few seconds to work with the viewer to establish where what the world is they are entering and where they stand in it. It is critical to the success of a film that this is right. It is why genres are so strong film; there is no relief from the moving forward of the narrative. Big films today can do that by showing a synopsis of the whole movie in the long trailers we have. And title sequences have become extremely effective: an art in itself.

By here in 1938, they took those few precious minutes for this strange dialog.

Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",0
2,"it's surprising to me how much this movie gets ripped on saying it is an exploitation of little people. honestly, this is a classic western story; good guy in white, bad guy in black. it wasn't made as a comedy, but is it funny? yes it can be, for the novelty of it. is it a blockbuster? now, just an average 'B' western from the 30's, but definitely worth watching at least once.

i enjoy this movie not because it exploits anyone, but that they did go to great detail to make a story, a drama with an all midget cast. these are the same little people that were in the ""Wizard of Oz"", so they got to do a classic kind of film. this unique type of movie is one that will never be copied or re-done due to peoples stereotypes, it's an original.

I'm not saying it's some masterpiece, but it is definitely worth seeing once!",1
3,"THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN enjoys something of a cult reputation as one of the ""worst films ever made"" and is notorious for being a musical western enacted solely by dwarf actors (or midgets, as they're credited in the opening titles). However, this isn't that bad at all; it comes across as a distinctly average but mildly enjoyable western with the added novelty of having the entire cast populated by dwarf actors.

It's fair to say that the acting isn't a strong point here, but the dwarfs certainly are enthusiastic performers and you can't fault their efforts in that respect. The musical scenes fare less well due to the high pitched nature of the voices, but the cattle rustling plot is more interesting and there's even a little romance to be enjoyed here. THE TERROR OF TINY TOWN is a unique film, yes, but in many ways it's all rather predictable and ordinary for the era. There are far, far worse films out there too.",0
4,"Well, I've been curious about this movie for years and now I've finally seen it: ""The Terror of Tiny Town"" (1938), a Western/musical with an all-dwarf cast! In many respects it's just a typical Western-- dashing hero attempts to save/woo gorgeous gal and fight off cattle rustlers at the same time (one such rustler tries to frame the hero for murder). The film starts with an average-sized man introducing the diminiutive stars; including the hero, ""Buck Lawson"" (played by Billy Curtis, who has been in several movies and even has a walk-on in ""the Incredible Shrinking Man"".)

""Tiny Town"" is populated entirely by little people(or ""midgets"" as some have called them). They ride ponies instead of horses, but everything in town seems scaled for average sized people. Thus the image of cowboys sauntering UNDER half-doors into saloons! To be honest I think SOME of the ""dwarf"" actors were actually average-sized children. In one scene, a barbershop quartet sings and a ""dwarf"" in a chair sings along in a much deeper voice than you'd expect. That ""dwarf"" looks more like an average-sized little boy in reality.

But then more than a few of the (adult) little people in the cast look like kids (but aren't)-- not just height-wise but they also have very-young-looking faces. You almost think it's a film of kids playing adults (ever see ""Bugsy Malone""?) but they are indeed dwarfs.

You get the typical elements of an ""oater"" (Western), from shoot-em-ups to a seductive female singer in a saloon; some very bad puns (""smallpox"", ""half-pint""); a hero-and-girl duet that will conjure up images of Nelson Eddy and Jeanette McDonald (all together now: ""when I'm calling you-u-u-u""--though to be honest, the songs in ""Tiny Town"" are VERY forgettable!)...a dwarf drinking a huge beer stein, and a duel in a shack where dynamite is about to go off!

So is it great or horrible? Kind of in between; unusual enough (in that it has an all-dwarf cast) to see at least once, but cliched dialogue, weak songs, etc....still, now at least I can say I've seen The Terror of Tiny Town!

(PS--I must add that in many respects the film is the type that exploits little-person actors for their size instead of whatever other talents they may have. How many dwarf actors out there go to a casting call and immediately are told, ""ah! We'll make you the leprechaun...the tiny space alien...one of Santa's elves..."" etc. instead of more substantial roles... )",1
5,"This movie has all the classic elements usually found in westerns of the 1930's - 1950's. The dashing hero, the fair damsel in need of rescuing, the despised villain, singing, dancing, the big chase scene. It's all here. But, the one thing that separates this movie from any other western is the cast. 100% midgets. Yep, this entire movie is cast with actors under the height of 4 feet 8 inches, with a couple of fellas who just might make three feet.

The hook of this movie is the fact that it's all midgets. The dialog and actions could be found in any western made in this time period. Nothing is outstanding about this movie, but then nothing is bad about it. It's just something different. Although, you haven't seen a true chase scene until you see a group of guys chasing each other on Shetland ponies.",0
6,"Possible spoilers.

If you enjoy watching 1930's B Westerns  especially singing westerns  you'll enjoy watching this imaginative romp through the Wild West.

Take any standard ""oater"" and cast little people  with the emphasis on people  in the roles of a hero caught between two feuding cattle barons and an evil rustler trying to steal his girl - - and you'll have an idea what this film is about. All of the elements are here  from a hero falsely accused of murder and facing a lynch mob - - to the final showdown and his saving the damsel in distress from the evil villain.

Several performances were clearly outstanding and truly enjoyable to watch: Billy Curtis as the hero - Buck Lawson; Nita Krebs as the Vamp(ire)  Nita and especially Charles (Mayor of Munchkin City) Becker as the Cook  Otto - - who stole each and every scene. (His scene with the duck is priceless).

Of minor note was the fact that many of the actors and actresses in the barroom scenes appear to have had German accents  which makes some words of their songs a little difficult to understand at first  but in subsequent viewings this proved to be no problem - - especially since the delightful lyrics of the Lew Porter Song  ""Mister Jack and Missus Jill""  more than compensated.

Additionally  although the director (Sam Newfield) chose to dub some songs with voices from professional singers  which proved to be a minor irritant as far as continuity is concerned  this was standard practice for 1930s oaters. (Does anyone dare to forget John Wayne in RIDERS OF DESTINY as Singin' Sandy Saunder?).

However  all-in-all - this film was truly enjoyable.

In closing  I'd like to comment on the fact that it is sad that many comments I've read reflect the fact that many folks cannot get past their bias toward little people - - - and view little people playing real roles as real people as something only to be laughed at.

Please watch this film with an open mind and you could be pleasantly surprised!!!",1
7,"This film is a genuine novelty. The film has been put together as a straightforward B-Western as produced in the late 1930s. It appears to have been filmed on the same locations as dozens of other B-Westerns, with a stock, wall-to-wall music score. The difference is when you see and hear the players. This takes a few minutes to get used to, but once you are into it, you start to get caught up in the story and don't even notice the fact that the entire cast is made up of ""little people"". The acting in this ranges from fair to good, and the direction is as good as in any Roy Rogers or Gene Autry opus. This is not a bad little film and well worth your time if you are in the mood for something different.",0
8,"The standard issue plot consists of the title villain rustling cattle and sparking a range war between two rival ranchers, who each suspect the other.

This is the first and only all little person musical western film. Once the novelty wears off though, The Terror Of Tiny Town starts to look like a typical 1930's poverty row programmer, of which director Sam Newfield is strongly associated.

Billy Curtis, who went on to co-star alongside Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter, makes an appealing hero. The musical numbers (some of which were dubbed) are well done and the climax is surprisingly good.

The producers should have cast Mickey Rooney as a giant!",1
9,"It's been a number of years since I saw this masterpiece...and I still laugh when I think about it. How can you not like something as off the wall as this flick.

Aside from the small people and small ponies, etc., I was most surprised by the singing. Not that singing westerns are a novelty, mind you, it's just that after hearing the leading lady squeak like a munchkin, I wasn't prepared for the leading man to have a full, booming, Nelson Eddie-type voice.

This one's a natural for a night with friends, a large bowl of popcorn and plenty of substitute dialog.",1
10,"Frankly, everything has already been said by previous users. Yes, it's ludicrous. Yes, it's boring. Yes, it's clichéd. Yes, it's badly acted.

But, COME ON, this was intended as a Columbia ""C"" filler to begin with. Think about it....... ""Oz"" was already filming, or soon to start, with ALL of these actors as ""Munchkins."" (Well, ""Tex"" isn't in ""Oz,"" but every other name appears.) What better way to get some cheap studio material into the theaters? The little people were already making news in the trades.....you'd better BELIEVE Columbia utilized the situation.

Charles Becker, as the cook, has some funny moments, considering the quality of every other performance. And, Billy Curtis, as the hero, actually comes across as a miniaturized version of the standard Hollywood Western star.

As a curiosity, it is definitely worth watching once, with friends and a few margaritas.",0

12,"Ok, so when I voted I gave it a low score, but that was cause Terror of Tiny Town has very little cinematic merit. But put all that aside and wind your sense of humour down a couple of notches and this movie is a ""rootin, tootin, shootin"" good time. I mean come on! They walk UNDER the saloon door! They ride ponies! It takes two midgets to play the bass! The bartender can't seem to chug his beer without outbursts of laughter! Plus- midgets fighting- funny! Add to that the fact that not a single one of the midgets can act and you've got 63 minutes of fun! Ok, so I realize that this movie is so politically incorrect that ""little people"" everywhere are either laughing themselves to death or up in arms. But that shouldn't stop us from enjoying an entirely midget western with multiple ear shattering musical numbers and the barest traces of a plot. But like I said before- midgets-Funny!",0
13,"Tiny Town is a town of little people. Cattle rustler Jim 'Tex' Preston is returning after getting driven out fifteen years earlier. Buck Lawson has to take him and his gang down once more. This is a film oddity. While most of the tiny actors are trying, the filmmaker is obviously counting on the camp quality. It's meant to be funny. Look at all the little people riding little horses. That's the intention here. The audience is meant to laugh at these actors.

I get it. I'm willing to overlook it and hope for some good work nevertheless. The acting is a mixed bag. Many of them could be good stunt people, but their acting is mostly bad. Also the munchkin voices do not elevate the acting quality. It sounds silly. It's an oddity that leaves me with mixed feelings. I'm definitely not laughing at this as was intended.",0
14,"This movie is a cult classic. The main reason it is a classic, of course, is that the cast is made up entirely of little people (or midgets, as they were referred to back in the 1930's, when this movie was made.)

I can only imagine some bigwigs in Hollywood sitting around the boardroom table, and someone saying, ""Hey...let's make a western musical with an all midget cast!"" and everyone chiming in and saying, ""Yeah, that's a great idea!"". I mean, what were they thinking? Now let me start off by saying I have nothing at all against little people. But the premise for this movie is pretty bizarre. Was it meant to be serious, or taken as a joke? It is exploitation of the midget actors, making fun of them, or was it meant to be a serious attempt at a western musical, just starring little people? These questions go mainly unanswered.

I think the actors performed with all seriousness in their roles, even though it seems to me that the script was poking fun at them, having them ride miniature ponies (which is hilarious to see) and having them walk under normal size barroom doors and the like.

Other than the cast being made up entirely of little people, there is nothing to distinguish this movie from the hundreds of other westerns made during the 1930's...low budget, cheap sets, terrible acting and atrocious songs (The song, ""The Wedding of Jack and Jill"", is unintentionally a howler). I think everyone should see this movie at least once. It happens to be a part of a 20 movie DVD compilation put out by Mill Creek Entertainment entitled ""Cult Classics"". It has the notorious movies ""Reefer Madness"", ""Cocaine Fiends"", ""Sex Mad"" and ""Terror of Tiny Town"", as well as many others included in the set. Most of these movies are exploitation films of the thirties and they are a gas to watch.",0

16,"One wonders who thought this would be a great idea--a western done straight with all midgets. Plot-wise this is like any other B western--two neighboring ranchers suspect each other of rustling their cattle. The Hero (that's how he's billed in the cast--Billy Curtis) of one ranch falls in love with the Girl (Yvonne Moray) of the other ranch! And the Villain (Little Billy) tries to frame the Hero.

The plot is as old as the hills and every single Western cliché is firmly in place. Also there are songs! The movie opens with the entire town singing a nauseating song about how happy they are! There's there's a saloon vamp (Nita Krebs) who squeaks out a few more (and very badly too). The acting is truly horrendous and (cinematically speaking) this movie is worthless. After the initial novelty of the midgets wears off this is pretty lame stuff. Still it moves quick and is only about an hour long. Also there are some good action scenes--if you can get past the midgets riding ponies instead of horses! I give this a 3 because it does have its moments and you have to admire the fact that the whole movie is played straight.",0
17,"Well, not exactly Tod Browning, or a very smooth Tod Browning, but not so far from FREAKS or THE UNKNOWN, because only cast with Little People. For the rest, nothing really disturbing, only a classical scheme for a western, except that it is entirely played by little people. A curiosity worth watching, and also a Sam Newfield's movie, one of his most strange stuff. And don't forget that he also brought us HARLEM ON THE PRAIRIE, only played by Black folks. And in the thirties, believe me, it was very very rare, weird. But from Sam Newfield nothing can surprise us after all. It may seem funny, because we are not used to watch such films, played by Little People, as if they were small kids.",1
18,"I differ from critics who think the flick demeans little people. Instead I think the hour humanizes the little folks beyond whatever initial curiosity and strangeness there might be. After all, the narrative simply substitutes midgets for usual size people in stock cowboy film roles. And once the initial strangeness of size slackens, the humanity of the characters takes over. Then too, it's a studio production (Columbia) giving it more respectability than an exploitation outfit. Oh sure, the film stands as a slice of exotica that has never been repeated, as far as I know. Still, size is never mocked, except for the swinging saloon doors; while some such spicing-up may have been tempting given the stock story, I'm glad the producers resisted it. Anyway, the oddity should not be passed up since there's a valuable lesson there for each generation.

(In passing- the cast is made up of midgets, not dwarves. My understanding is that midgets are in proportion from head to toe; whereas dwarves are little people too but have some body part out of proportion such as a normal size head giving them quite a different appearance from midgets. Indeed, a movie featuring the latter may have presented an even bigger lesson than TTT.)",0
19,"This film was produced by Jed Buell, shortly after he parted ways with the Stan Laurel Corporation as the producer of the Spectrum-Fred Scott westerns, as an independent production and released in September of 1937 through the various states rights exchanges across the country. It had its own Jed Buell-identified press book, posters and ads and campaign. It had many play-dates in theatres across the US in 1937.

It had so many bookings in 1937, based on the novelty---key word---of the film, that it became somewhat of an attention-getter and buzz-talk around town---a novelty in itself that any film produced by Jed Buell could even get any attention from the Hollywood community. So Columbia Pictures Corporation, who had absolutely nothing to do with the production of this film, and probably didn't even know it was being produced, came up short one B-feature promised to its exchanges and exhibitors for the 1937-38 production schedule, and just purchased the rights to and all distribution rights for ""The Terror of Tiny Town"" from Jed Buell Productions.

They then pasted Columbia Pictures Corp. Presents on the film's title-card frame, right over where it formerly said Jed Buell Presents, made up a new press book, lobby cards and posters with Columbia Pictures Presents written on them, and shipped the kit-and-kaboodle to their film exchanges scattered around the U.S.

Buying product outside was nothing new for Columbia; they had previously done the same on ""Heroes of the Alamo,"" which Columbia also did not produce.",1
20,"The novelty value of a tale of little people in the big country quickly wears off thanks to an otherwise dull and routine production. The songs are catchy but weird (and at times a little creepy) and the whole thing has a Bugsy Malone feel to it, as if the actors were kids rather than diminutive adults. Oh yeah, has anyone mentioned that they walk under saloon doors...?",0
21,The Terror Of Tiny Town could have just as easily been made as a regular grade B western starring a cowboy star such as Gene Autry or Roy Rogers. However making this movie with an all little person cast was indeed brilliant giving these people a chance to do serious movie acting.,1
22,"There may be worse movies. Yes, indeed, there may be worse movies. That doesn't mean I want to see them, or be near them or even hear of them. You can have your director's ouevre, your Ed Wood, your own particular claim that a particular movie is the Worst Movie Ever Made. I don't really care.

When it comes to High Concept Pictures, this ranks up there with Jules White's ""Dogville"" series, in which inoffensive puppies are stuffed into costumes, wired into position and then made to stand around, urinating on themselves, after which voices are dubbed into a satire of ""the Face on the Bar Room Floor""; or ""The Three Fatties"" series: If they laugh at fat comics, and they laugh at at movie teams, then how about a movie team of three men who tip the scale at 300 pounds each? Yeah, that's High Concept!

Well, the High Concept here was to cross the Singing Western -- itself a slightly bizarre idea -- with the idea of an All Midget movie. They'll love it!

At least, the producer did. The midgets were cheap, the script available for pennies -- mostly endless repetition of ""He wants to be the biggest man in the county!"" and the songs... well, they ain't Gershwin.

Has to be seen to be believed, and even then you won't.",0
